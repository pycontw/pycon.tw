<h2>Keynotes</h2>

<p>PyCon Taiwan invites three speakers to give keynote speeches during the two-day conference. Each keynote speaker is
	considered one of the most important figures in their respective fields. They share their professional experience and
	the image of their domain’s future.</p>

<p>More information about <em>keynotes</em> can be found on the <a
		href="{{ events_keynote_url }}">{% trans 'Keynotes' %}</a> page.</p>


<h2>Talks</h2>

<p>The two conference days are packed with talks about Python by speakers from Taiwan and around the world. The talks
	will be either 30- or 15-minute long. Three tracks of talks will be delivered simultaneously, all with different
	topics and difficulties. We suggest you to make a schedule beforehand, and choose what you want ot listen based on
	your interests. Many people take notes on the program schedule before the meeting so they don’t run to wrong places.
</p>

	page.</p>


<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>Tutorial are events held as part of the main conference, but attendees need to register separately in order to join.
	They are 1.5 hours events held to help participants better understand talks during the conference, or get their hands
	on more Python applications.</p>

<p>More information about <em>tutorials</em> can be found on the <a
		href="{{ events_tutorial_url }}">{% trans 'Tutorials' %}</a> page.</p>


<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>

<p>Lightning talks are held at the end of each conference day. It’s known for its fast-paced nature that allows only 5
	minutes for each talk, including setup. If you would like to give a lightning talk, please write down your name and
	the subject on a piece of paper, and put it into the jar near the registration desk. We will announce in each noon the
	list of talks for the day.</p>


<h2>Open Spaces</h2>

<p>Open Spaces are held both in parallel with the main conference, and during a dedicated slot at the three day of the
	conference. The schedule is created just-in-time by the attendees. If you would like to host an Open Space event,
	please use an Open Space card found in your goodies bag, fill it and pin it on the Open Space board.</p>

		href="{{ events_openspaces_url }}">{% trans 'Open Spaces' %}</a> page.</p>


<h2>Job Fair</h2>

<p>Job Fair is a career expo for Python developers. During the Job Fair session, our sponsors will take turns introduce
	themselves on the stage and promote their job openings. For attendees that are looking for a career, this is a great
	opportunity for you to interact with the sponsors or submit your rèsumè!</p>


<h2>Community Track</h2>

<p>The community track is a new event in PyCon TW. We choose the talks with specific topics and package them into the
	same session. We'll leave the conference rooms and go to characteristic cafes, exhibition spaces, and even monuments
	so that the attendees and speakers can interact with each other more comfortably and closely.</p>

<p>In short, the "community track" is to build strong connections between attendees, speakers, sponsors, and
	communities!</p>

<p>The community track will take place in the afternoon of day 2 (9/6), with a duration of 3 hours, including 90-minute
	talks arranged by PyCon Taiwan.</p>

<p>More information about <em>Community Track</em> can be found on the <a
		href="{{ community_track_url }}">{% trans 'Community Track' %}</a> page.</p>


<h2>Sprints</h2>

<p>Sprints are held out of the main conference. A sprint event gathers open source project owners, contributors, and
	people who wants to contribute but trying to find a place to start. During a sprint, project hosts bring their
	unresolved issues or new features under development and share with everyone. You can join a project of your choice, or
	bring your own project here!</p>

<p>For those who already knows fundamentals of Python and wants to participate open source projects, but doesn't know
	where to start, sprints are great opportunities to get yourself involved! As for project hosts, this is a great chance
	for you to find people with similar interests, having face-to-face interactions with contributors, and getting new
	contributors to your project's development! Be prepared to get your hands dirty!</p>

<h2>PyNight</h2>

<p>PyNight is an extension to the BoF event we held in previous years. This year's event is expanded to provide a more
	diverse occasion for the community. It consists of both “music” and “communication” parts. During the music event, the
	protagonist is a group of versatile friends from the community, bringing their carefully prepared music. In the
	community event, you are the protagonist! No matter what your thoughts, you can find like-minded friends here; the
	subject without any restrictions, as long as you are interested, everything is welcome.</p>
