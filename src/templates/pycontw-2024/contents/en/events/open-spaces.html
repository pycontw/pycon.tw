	<h1>Open Spaces</h1>
</section>

<p>Open Spaces are self-organizing meetup events which happen simultaneously with the main conference. Open Spaces are organized during the period of PyCon by attendees, which provides a way for you to define, organize, plain out the meetup as you preferred. Enjoy the Open Space while making new friends, chat about any topic youâ€™d like at the same time.</p>

<p>For those who have participated in previous PyCon Taiwan, Open Spaces may sound familiar to you. Yes! itâ€™s basically the good old <a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/bof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoF (Birds of a Feather)</a>, but with a name that is more comprehensive to new conference attendees.</p>

<h2>How do I participate in an Open Space?</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s pretty easy: Just show up :)</p>

<p>Instead of Academia Sinica, this yearâ€™s PyCon will be hosted at International Conference Hall in National Cheng Kung University. Therefore, the Open Space has its dedicated space. Just find a subject that interests you, greet with the host, and enjoy!</p>


<h2>Where and when are the Open Spaces?</h2>

<p>Location: The Multifunction Room located at the first floor of the conference.</p>

<p>Time: Between the morning keynote ended and afternoon keynote started of day 1 (11:10 ~ 16:30) and from the morning keynote ended till noon of day 2 (10:10 ~ 12:10).</p>


<h2>What Open Spaces are there?</h2>

<p>We donâ€™t know either! Itâ€™s up to you and fellow attendees ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Just like the attendees, Open Spaces are very versatile. There are no limits to the subject of the Open Space! An Open Space can be a mani/pedi party, a feminist hacking space, an AcroYoga space, or even a board games room. It can also be a discussion about any of the technical subjects, from computer security to your favorite Python project to professional occupation such as SRE.</p>

<h2>How do I host an Open Space?</h2>

<p>Just get a whiteboard from the information desk, fill in the subject, time and your name and youâ€™re all set!</p>

<p>For those who want to get the event started immediately, simply find a desk and place the whiteboard in front of it. Otherwise, you can leave the whiteboard at the information desk and get it back when your event starts.</p>

<h2>Ideas for Open Spaces</h2>

<p>Here are a few ideas for potential Open Space topics and activities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hacker space (maker projects) that use Python (e.g. in Raspberry Pis, IOT, home automation, robots / drones / blimps autopiloted with Python)</li>
	<li>Hacking / networking / devops</li>
	<li>Data visualization / science</li>
	<li>Natural language processing and generation (e.g. chatbots)</li>
	<li>Quantified self</li>
	<li>Diversity initiatives, for example a feminist hackerspace</li>
	<li>A space for organizers of conferences, workshops, diversity initiatives (Django Girls, PyLadies, etc.)</li>
	<li>Framework-specific Open Spaces, e.g. Django or Flask</li>
	<li>How to contribute to open source, a help / mentoring group for beginners</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>Support: how to avoid burnout</li>
	<li>Recruitment workshops</li>
</ul>
