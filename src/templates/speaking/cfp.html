            Since one of the PyCon motivation is to help Python education
            and advocate the use of Python, by default your talks wil be
            recorded, edited and uploaded to
                <a href="http://pyvideo.org" target="_blank">pyvideo.org</a>
            by the PyCon Taiwan committee. If you donâ€™t want your talk being
            recorded, make sure you toggle the recording option during the
            proposal submission.  See more info about the
                <a href="{{ speaking_recording_url }}"
                  target="_blank">Recoding Release</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that speakers are required to buy the conference ticket as well.
          (see [Everyone Pays Policy]).

        <h2>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</h2>
        <h3>Talks</h3>
        <p>
            We accept a broad range of Python related proposals, from reports on
            academic and commercial projects and case studies. Basically, if you
            are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!
        </p>
        <p>
            The theme of PyCon TW 2016 is "Implement the future together".
            Therefore, we encourage speakers to talk about your own Python
            package or your experience of learning Python and hosting a Python
            community. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most talks are 25 minutes long. However, we offer a limited number
            of 45-minute slots for important topics which we think audience can
            benefit significantly more from an more extensive treatment. Note
            that the talk time length includes setup and Q&amp;A time.
        </p>
        <p>Talk can be given in either English or Chinese.</p>
        <p>
            We redesign the proposal form to make it better help speakers to
            organize their idea. Find more at <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How
            to Propose a Talk</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Tutorials</h3>
        <p>TBD</p>
