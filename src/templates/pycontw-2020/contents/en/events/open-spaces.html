<h1>Open Spaces</h1>

<p>Open Spaces are self-organizing meetup events which happen simultaneously with the main conference. Open Spaces are organized during the period of PyCon by attendees, which provides a way for you to define, organize, plain out the meetup as you preferred. Enjoy the Open Space while making new friends, chat about any topic you’d like at the same time.</p>

<p>For those who have participated in previous PyCon Taiwan, Open Spaces may sound familiar to you. Yes! it’s basically the good old <a href="https://tw.pycon.org/2014apac/en/bof/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoF (Birds of a Feather)</a>, but with a name that is more comprehensive to new conference attendees.</p>

<h2>How do I participate in an Open Space?</h2>

<p>It’s pretty easy: Just show up :)</p>

<p>Instead of Academia Sinica, this year’s PyCon will be hosted at International Conference Hall in National Cheng Kung University. Therefore, the Open Space has its dedicated space. Just find a subject that interests you, greet with the host, and enjoy!</p>


<h2>Where and when are the Open Spaces?</h2>

<p>Location: The Multifunction Room located at the first floor of the conference.</p>

<p>Time: Between the morning keynote ended and afternoon keynote started of day 1 (11:10 ~ 16:30) and from the morning keynote ended till noon of day 2 (10:10 ~ 12:10).</p>


<h2>What Open Spaces are there?</h2>

<p>We don’t know either! It’s up to you and fellow attendees 😉</p>

<p>Just like the attendees, Open Spaces are very versatile. There are no limits to the subject of the Open Space! An Open Space can be a mani/pedi party, a feminist hacking space, an AcroYoga space, or even a board games room. It can also be a discussion about any of the technical subjects, from computer security to your favorite Python project to professional occupation such as SRE.</p>

<h2>How do I host an Open Space?</h2>

<p>Just get a whiteboard from the information desk, fill in the subject, time and your name and you’re all set!</p>

<p>For those who want to get the event started immediately, simply find a desk and place the whiteboard in front of it. Otherwise, you can leave the whiteboard at the information desk and get it back when your event starts.</p>

<h2>Ideas for Open Spaces</h2>

<p>Here are a few ideas for potential Open Space topics and activities:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hacker space (maker projects) that use Python (e.g. in Raspberry Pis, IOT, home automation, robots / drones / blimps autopiloted with Python)</li>
	<li>Hacking / networking / devops</li>
	<li>Data visualization / science</li>
	<li>Natural language processing and generation (e.g. chatbots)</li>
	<li>Quantified self</li>
	<li>Diversity initiatives, for example a feminist hackerspace</li>
	<li>A space for organizers of conferences, workshops, diversity initiatives (Django Girls, PyLadies, etc.)</li>
	<li>Framework-specific Open Spaces, e.g. Django or Flask</li>
	<li>How to contribute to open source, a help / mentoring group for beginners</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>Support: how to avoid burnout</li>
	<li>Recruitment workshops</li>
</ul>
