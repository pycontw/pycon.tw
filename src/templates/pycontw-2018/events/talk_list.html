<article>
	<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}The two conference days are packed with talks about Python by speakers from Taiwan and around the world. The talks will be either 30- or 45-minute long. Three tracks of talks will be delivered simultaneously, all with different topics and difficulties. We suggest you to plan beforehand, and choose what you want to listen based on your interests. Many people take notes on the program schedule before the meeting so they don't end up in the wrong place.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
