<h1>Financial Aid</h1>

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p><a href="http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everybody Pays</a> is one of PyCon’s core principles. All attendees including speakers, chairperson, staff and volunteers have to pay for registering. While following this convention, PyCon Taiwan also has a financial aid program to help friends in the community, financially or otherwise, so more people are able join us in the big event.</p>

<p>All who look for help attending the conference are welcomed to apply. The organizers will review all applications, and allocate resources based on both the conference budget, and the applicants’ conditions.</p>

<p>While we hope to support everyone to participate in the community, the budget is unfortunately limited, and so is the financial aid program. In cases of insufficient resources, we wish to support those who are most in need, and to maximize community gain available from the applicant’s participation. As such, we may be forced to turn down your application to prioritize others.</p>

<p>The procedure of the application is what follows:</p>
