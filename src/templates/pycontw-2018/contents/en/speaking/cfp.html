	<li>Talks &amp; Tutorial CfP ends: 5 Mar (After 23:59, UTC+8)</li>
	<li>Announcement of acceptance: 1 May (tentative)</li>
</ul>

<p>All talks will be recorded, edited then uploaded to <a href="http://pyvideo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pyvideo.org</a> by the PyCon Taiwan committee, unless the speaker requests otherwise. See more info about the <a href="{{ speaking_recording_url }}">recording release</a>.</p>

<p>All speakers are required to buy their own conference tickets (<a href="http://jessenoller.com/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyone Pays</a>).</p>


<h2>How to Submit Your Proposal</h2>

<p>You need to <a href="{{ signup_url }}">sign up</a> a new account on tw.pycon.org. With an activated account, you can fill up the speaker profile and create new proposals through the <a href="{{ dashboard_url }}">My PyCon</a> page.</p>

<p>We encourage you to submit the proposal as early as possible. You are welcomed to submit multiple proposals.</p>


<h2>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</h2>

<h3>Talks</h3>

<p>We accept a broad range of Python related proposals, from reports on academic to commercial projects and case studies. Basically, if you are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!</p>

<p>We encourage speakers to talk about your own Python package or application, your experience of learning Python or hosting a Python community etc. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well. For your inspiration, our committee has suggested that they’d love to see talks on following topics: <em>A.I, Community, Data Analytics, IoT, Machine Learning, FinTech, Testing.</em></p>

<p>Most talks are <em>30 minutes</em> long. However, we offer a limited number of <em>45-minute</em> slots for important topics which we think the audience can benefit significantly more from a more extensive treatment. Note that the talk time length <em>includes setup and Q&amp;A time</em>.</p>

<p>Talks can be given in either <em>English, Chinese or Taiwanese.</em></p>

<p>
    We have redesigned the proposal form to make it better
    for speakers to organize their idea. Find more at
    <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How to Propose a Talk?</a>.
</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>
    Similar to talks, we don’t pose limitations on tutorial topics.
    Tutorials are half or full day long, equivalently to 3 or 6 hours of teaching.
    The guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks,
    so make sure you have read <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}"> How to Propose a Talk?</a>
    On top of that, We have some special requirements for tutorial submission,
    please refer to <a href="{{ speaking_tutorial_url }}">How to Propose a Tutorial?</a>
    for more information.
</p>

<h3>Open Spaces</h3>

<p>TBD</p>

<h2>Proposals Review Process</h2>

<p>After the Call for Proposal ends, and before the announcement of acceptance, the PyCon TW 2018 Proposals Review Committee is going to review the proposals and give scores and provide useful feebacks. The process consists of three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 Review: Reviewers are going to score and give feedbacks. This will last for about 2 ~ 3 weeks</li>
  <li><em>Modification Step: According to reviewers’ comments, you can modify your proposal through the dashboard.</em> This steps lasts for about 1 to 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Stage 2 Review: Reviewers are going to re-score and re-give feedacks to the modified proposals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modification Step</h3>
<p>
  Between the stage-1 and stage-2 review, you can see the feedbacks from the reviewer.
  You may modify your proposal according to reviewers’ comments or feedbacks. If you want to make your change obvious to the reviewers, you can point out the ID of the comment, and mention about what you’ve modified according to the comment in the <em>"Supplementary"</em> section, e.g. <em>"#4: Updated the time management for xxx phase"</em>
</p>
