        Since one of the PyCon motivation is to help Python education
        and advocate the use of Python, by default your talks wil be
        recorded, edited and uploaded to
            <a href="http://pyvideo.org" target="_blank">pyvideo.org</a>
        by the PyCon Taiwan committee. If you don’t want your talk being
        recorded, make sure you toggle the recording option during the
        proposal submission.  See more info about the
            <a href="{{ speaking_recording_url }}"
              target="_blank">Recoding Release</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that speakers are required to buy the conference ticket as well.
      (see [Everyone Pays Policy]).
    </p>
    <h2>How to Submit Your Proposal</h2>
    <p>
        You need to <a href="{{ signup_url }}">sign up</a> a new account on
        tw.pycon.org. With an activated account, you can fill up the speaker
        profile and create new proposals through your
        <a href="{{ dashboard_url }}">Dashboard</a>.
    </p>
    <p>We encourage you to submit the proposal as early as possible.</p>

    <h2>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</h2>
    <h3>Talks</h3>
    <p>
        We accept a broad range of Python related proposals, from reports on
        academic and commercial projects and case studies. Basically, if you
        are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!
    </p>
    <p>
        The theme of PyCon TW 2016 is "Implement the future together".
        Therefore, we encourage speakers to talk about your own Python
        package or your experience of learning Python and hosting a Python
        community. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most talks are 25 minutes long. However, we offer a limited number
        of 45-minute slots for important topics which we think audience can
        benefit significantly more from a more extensive treatment. Note
        that the talk time length includes setup and Q&amp;A time.
    </p>
    <p>Talk can be given in either English or Chinese.</p>
    <p>
        We redesign the proposal form to make it better help speakers to
        organize their idea. Find more at <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How
        to Propose a Talk</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Tutorials</h3>
    <p>
        Similar to talks, we don't pose limitations on tutorial topics. Tutorial
        are half or full day long, equivalently to 3 or 6 hours of teaching. The
        guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks,
        so make sure you have read <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How to
        Propose a Talk</a>. On top of that, We have some special requirements
        for tutorial submission, please refer to
        <a href="{{ speaking_tutorial_url }}">How to Propose a Tutorial</a>
        for more information.
    </p>
