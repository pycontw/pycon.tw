    <h2><span>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</span></h2>
    <h3>Talks</h3>
    	<article>
	      <p>
	          We accept a broad range of Python related proposals, from reports on
	          academic to commercial projects and case studies. Basically, if you
	          are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!
	      </p>
	      <p>
	          The theme of PyCon TW 2017 is <strong>"Define The Future"</strong>.
	          Therefore, we encourage speakers to talk about your own Python
	          application or your experience of using Python or hosting a Python
	          community. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	          Most talks are <strong>30 minutes</strong> long. However, we offer a limited number
	          of 45-minute slots for important topics which we think audience can
	          benefit significantly more from a more extensive treatment. Note
	          that the talk time length <strong>includes setup and Q&amp;A time</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p>Talk can be given in either <strong>English, Chinese or Taiwanese.</strong></p>
	      <p>
	          We have redesigned the proposal form to make it better help speakers to
	          organize their idea. Find more at <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How
	          to Propose a Talk</a>.
	      </p>
	    </article>
    <h3>Unconference</h3>
    	<article>
	      <p>
	        We’re going to open a new <strong>“Unconference”</strong> track (on the last day), our
	        purpose is to provide different interaction between speakers and audiences.
	        For unconference talks, not only Python-related proposals are accepted, any
	        indirectly related topics are also welcomed. Unconference talks are voted
	        and thus decided by conference attendees. (The current plan is to open for
	        unconference proposal submission 10 days before the conference starts)
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        An unconference talk <strong>lasts 20 minutes</strong>, note that <strong>the Q&amp;A session is
	        included</strong> in the 20 minutes.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        An unconference talk can be run in any form, the speaker / host can decide
	        the way he / she uses that space and time. Furthermore, unconference talks
	        are not officially recorded in any ways, thus any topics that are more critical
	        compared to the regular conference talks are welcomed.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        Unconferences can be spoken in <strong>Chinese, English or Taiwanese</strong>.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	        Please refer to <a
	            href="{{ speaking_unconference_url }}">Unconference Proposal</a>
	             for the unconference proposal format.
	      </p>
	    </article>
    <h3>Tutorials</h3>
      <article>
	      <p>
	        Similar to talks, we don't pose limitations on tutorial topics. Tutorial
	        are half or full day long, equivalently to 3 or 6 hours of teaching. The
	        guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks,
	        so make sure you have read <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How to
	        Propose a Talk</a>. On top of that, We have some special requirements
	        for tutorial submission, please refer to
	        <a href="{{ speaking_tutorial_url }}">How to Propose a Tutorial</a>
	        for more information.
