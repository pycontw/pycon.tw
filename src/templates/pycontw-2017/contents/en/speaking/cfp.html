  <p>We encourage you to submit the proposal as early as possible.</p>
</article>

<h2><span>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</span></h2>
  <article>
    <h3>Talks</h3>
    <p>
        We accept a broad range of Python related proposals, from reports on academic to commercial projects and case studies. Basically, if you are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!
    </p>
    <p>
        The theme of PyCon TW 2017 is <em>"Define The Future"</em>. Therefore, we encourage speakers to talk about your own Python application or your experience of using Python or hosting a Python community. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most talks are <em>30 minutes</em> long. However, we offer a limited number of <em>45-minute</em> slots for important topics which we think audience can benefit significantly more from a more extensive treatment. Note that the talk time length <em>includes setup and Q&amp;A time</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Talk can be given in either <em>English, Chinese or Taiwanese.</em></p>
    <p>
        We have redesigned the proposal form to make it better help speakers to organize their idea. Find more at <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How to Propose a Talk?</a>.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>Unconference</h3>
    <p>
      We’re going to open a new <em>“Unconference”</em> track (on the last day), our purpose is to provide different interaction between speakers and audiences. For unconference talks, not only Python-related proposals are accepted, any indirectly related topics are also welcomed. Unconference talks are voted and thus decided by conference attendees. (The current plan is to open for unconference proposal submission 10 days before the conference starts)
    </p>
    <p>
      An unconference talk can be run in any form, the speaker/host can decide the way he/she uses that space and time. Furthermore, unconference talks are not officially recorded in any ways, thus any topics that are more critical compared to the regular conference talks are welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unconference talk <em>lasts 20 minutes</em>, note that <em>the Q&amp;A session is included</em> in the 20 minutes. The system will open the registration 10 days before the conference, and the talk is voting decision by conference attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconferences can be spoken in <em>Chinese, English or Taiwanese</em>. Please refer to <a href="{{ speaking_unconference_url }}">How to Propose a Unconference Talk?</a> for the unconference proposal format.
    </p>
  </article>

    <h3>Tutorials</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to talks, we don't pose limitations on tutorial topics. Tutorial are half or full day long, equivalently to 3 or 6 hours of teaching. The guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks, so make sure you have read <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}"> How to Propose a Talk?</a> On top of that, We have some special requirements for tutorial submission, please refer to <a href="{{ speaking_tutorial_url }}">How to Propose a Tutorial?</a> for more information.
