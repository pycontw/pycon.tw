        Since one of the PyCon motivation is to help Python education and
        advocate the use Python, by default <em>all talks are recorded</em>.
        If the speaker agrees to give permission to PyCon Taiwan, we will
        record, edit, and release the audio and video of the speaker's
        presentation to online video site such as Youtube and
        <a href="http://pyvideo.org/" target="_blank">pyvideo.org</a>.
        The recording might be also live streamed if it is technically
        feasible.

        If you donâ€™t want your talk being recorded, make sure you leave the
        recording option unchecked during the proposal submission.
