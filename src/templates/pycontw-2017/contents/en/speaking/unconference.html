<h1><span>How to Propose a Unconference Talk?</span></h1>

<h2><span>Proposing</span></h2>
<article>
<p>We're going to use GitHub's Issues feature as our proposal and voting system for the unconference, so <a href="https://github.com/pycontw/unconference/issues/new">opening a new issue</a> is proposing an unconference talk. There are a few things you'll have to fill in when you propose:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Issue's title is your proposal's <b>title</b>.</li>
    <li>Issue's description is your proposal's <b>abstract</b>. e.g. What will you cover in your speech/discussion? What's your target audience? What kind of interaction would you like to have with the crowd?</li>
    <li>If you have any external footnotes, please also include them inside the issue's description.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To view the list of currently proposed proposals, please head to <a href="https://github.com/pycontw/unconference/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">the issues page</a></p>
</article>

<h2><span>Voting</span></h2>
<article>
  <p>Simply <b>adding a "+1 reaction" (üëç) against an issue</b> counts as a vote. You can vote for multiple proposals, and all the reactions other than "+1" don't count.</p>
