<h1><span>PyNight</span></h1>

<article>
	<p>PyNight is an extension to the BoF event we held in previous years. This year's event is expanded to provide a more diverse occasion for the community. It consists of both “music” and “communication” parts. During the music event, the protagonist is a group of versatile friends from the community, bringing their carefully prepared music. In the community event, you are the protagonist! No matter what your thoughts, you can find like-minded friends here; the subject without any restrictions, as long as you are interested, everything is welcome.</p>

<h2><span>BoF (Birds of a Feather)</span></h2>

<article>
	<p>According to Wikipedia, BoF is derived from the proverb “Birds of a feather flock together.” A BoF session is an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda.</p>

	<p>Any topic related to Python and PyCon is appreciated during BoF. Feel free to raise your own topic. We also provide an abundant supply of food!</p>
	<p>You can register as a host, and bring new or funny projects—fighting robots, LED control system, lighting, sound system, etc. If you find no time to prepare a project, you are also welcomed to sing a song, play some guitar, or anything.</p>
	<p>It is also great to just be an audience. Seize this opportunity to make friends, broaden your horizons, or recruit volunteers! Welcome to BoF!</p>
	<p>If you are willing to be a host at BoF, please send email to <a href="mailto:organizers@pycon.tw">organizers@pycon.tw</a> with the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your name.</li>
		<li>Your contact information (mobile phone and email).</li>
		<li>The topic you want to discuss, or the project, skill, or music you want to share.</li>
		<li>Required equipments. We provide desks and chairs, but please tell us in advance if you need other equipments. We will try our best to help.</li>
	</ul>
