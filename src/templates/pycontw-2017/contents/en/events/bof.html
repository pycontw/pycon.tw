<h2><span>What is BoF?</span></h2>
<article>
	<h3>Birds of a feather flock together</h3>
	<p>
		According to Wikipedia, BoF is derived from the proverb “Birds of a feather
		flock together.” A BoF session is an informal meeting at conferences, where
		the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out
		discussions without any pre-planned agenda.

		Do you want to share ideas and creative projects with others at PyCon TW?
		Everyone is welcomed to join the PyConTW 2017 BoF. Let us define the

	<h3>Do I Need to Prepare Anything?</h3>
	<p>
		Any topic related to Python and PyCon is appreciated during BoF. Feel free to
		raise your own topic. We also provide an abundant supply of food!
	</p>
	<p>
		You can register as a host, and bring new or funny projects—fighting robots,
		LED control system, lighting, sound system, etc. If you find no time to
		prepare a project, you are also welcomed to sing a song, play some guitar, or
		anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is also great to just be an audience. Seize this opportunity to make
		friends, broaden your horizons, or recruit volunteers! Welcome to BoF!
