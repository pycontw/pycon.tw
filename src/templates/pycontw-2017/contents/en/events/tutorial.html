		Tutorials are paid events that will be held 1 to 3 weeks before PyCon TW. They are held to help participants better understand talks during the conference, or get their hands on more Python applications. A tutorial can be either full-day (6 hours) or half-day (3 hours), with content selected by public proposal-calling.
