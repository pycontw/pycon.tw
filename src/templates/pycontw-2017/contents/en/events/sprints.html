		Sprints will be held out of the conference dates. During the sprint,
		open source project managers will bring their projects and explain their
		issues or any unresolved problem. After the introduction of all projects,
		people find their projects of interest and get involved. By this
		interaction possibility, one can dig deep into projects or fields they
		care.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is highly welcomed to bring oneâ€™s own project and find enthusiasts of
		same interest. For people with sufficient Python background who wants to
		join open source projects but having no clue or too shy to shout out
		on the mail list and public channels, sprints serve as a great chance to
		get involved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Running alongside there is a separate schedule of workshops in April for
		attendees who want to learn more about knowledge for specific topics.
