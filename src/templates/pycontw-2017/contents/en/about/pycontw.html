<h2><span>History of PyCon Taiwan</span></h2>
<article>
  <p>
    In 2008 and 2011, thinker organized PyCTW, the predecessor of PyCon Taiwan.
    At that time, PyCon was only an one-day event to keep Pythonistas together.
    (<a href="http://wiki.python.org.tw/PycTW2008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyCTW 2008</a>,
    <a href="http://wiki.python.org.tw/PycTW2011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyCTW 2011</a>）
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2012, yyc and volunteers from communities founded the first PyCon TW.
    The speeches were mainly about scientific computation as well as some
    introductions of Python-based tools. Since the first PyCon TW, the
    organizers have decided to follow the <a
      href="http://jessenoller.com/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everybody Pays</a> policy from PyCon US. That is,
    everyone, including the staffs and speakers of PyCon TW, is required to
    pay the ticket. First year of PyCon TW successfully attracted 250 audiences,
    which reached the maximum number of attendees. The chairperson,
    yyc, cheerfully recorded this milestone in <a
      href="http://yyc.solvcon.net/writing/2012/pycontw2012_finale.html"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2013, the reappointed chairperson, yyc, decided to expand the scale of
    PyCon TW and try several new events. For example, collaborated with
    caterpillar to host an paid Python tutorial before the conference. The
    tutorial was highly successful that many people came to ask if additional
    tutorials could be opened. Besides, it was the first time that the so-call
    night market activities, where communities hosted their own booths while
    attendees enjoyed the buffet with live music performance, were introduced
    to BoF (Birds of a Feather) event. These new events later became signature
    for PyCon TW. yyc summarized his thoughts about this year in <a
      href="http://yyc.solvcon.net/writing/2013/after_pycontw_2013/index.html"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog</a> as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2014, PyCon TW got the chance to host PyCon APAC/Taiwan. Tim Hsu was the
    chairperson of 2014. The slogan of 2014 was "from everything import python".
    A competition of problem solving in Python was launched in collaboration with
    <a href="http://www.checkio.org/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">CheckIO</a>. Also, apart from the speeches, Show Time and
    Job Event were organized for promoting sponsors.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2015, PyCon TW was responsible for PyCon APAC/Taiwan again. The chairperson
    of 2015 was Keith Yang. Since in the movie "Back to the Future II", the
    arrival time of Marty's time travel to the future was 2015, the slogan of that
    year was "Back to __future__II". The topics mainly focused on how to practice
    ideas via Python and apply Python in different research fields. Several
    tutorials, ranging from Python introduction, to web crawling, data mining,
    signal processing, and even the interaction with Raspberry Pi. At the end of
    the event, a live Bingo game was made for the lucky draw time. Combing with web
    programming, attendees were able to see their Bingo number and gaming status on
    their phone. The attendees were excited when the conditions of getting new
    lines from numbers got more and more weird.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2016, we turned to host PyCon TW again. "Implement the Future, Together!"

    2017 TBD

<h2><span>Python Communities in Taiwan</span></h2>

<article>
<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonhug/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hsinchu &mdash; Python Hsinchu User Group (PyHUG)</a></h3>
  <p>
    PyHUG, founded by yyc and Albert Huang in 2011, is the first Python user
    community in Taiwan. The meetup was first located at Operations Center for
    Industry Collaboration, NTHU, and was later moved to Information Technology
    Service Center, NCTU. Speakers were invited on a monthly basis. The majority
    of participants were university students, along with engineers from Hsinchu
    Science Park, linguists, and even Hsinchu police officers. Therefore, topics
    were mostly about scientific application in Python, which affected the focus
    of first PyCon TW. In recent years, the meetup, held in a coffee shop with
    around 20 attendees on every Wednesday, turns to be "eating, chatting, talking
    about Python and everything". Currently the community is organized by Dainese.
    They are looking for new face to join.

<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Taipei-py/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taipei &mdash; Taipei.py</a></h3>
  <p>
    After COSCUP 2012, Keith, Tim and some enthusiasts launched Taipei.py. The
    number of members rapidly grew up to 50 after the first few meetups. The
    events are hosted monthly at CLBC. The topics are mainly related to web
    programming and web application. Recently there are more sharing of big data
    topics. Since most of the organizers are in web-related industry, Andy also
    hosts other activities, such as Python Web Meetup and Django study group,
    besides the monthly meetups.

<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Tainan-py-Python-Tainan-User-Group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tainan &mdash; Tainan.py</a></h3>
  <p>
    In 2013, Joe founded Tainan.py when he moved from Taipei to Tainan due to the
    change of company location. Since jserv also became the faculty in Department
    of Computer Science and Information Engineering, NCKU, Joe decided to launch
    "Tainan.py × MOSUT" events with MOSUT, another community located in Tainan.
    In order to promote local Tainan food, local dishes, like fried chicken and
    almond soup, are provided during the break in Tainan.py. Monthly meetup takes
    place in the weekend afternoon, so attendees are welcome to try more Tainan
    food after the meetup if the local dishes during the break is just not enough :)

<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Kaohsiung-Python-Meetup/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaohsiung &mdash; Kaohsiung.py</a></h3>
  <p>
    Before Kaohsiung.py was founded, Python enthusiasts, like TooMore and CD,
    sometimes shared Python-related topics in the KSDG meetups. Founder of
    Kaohsiung.py is Victor Gau. He joined Tainan.py regularly until one day he
    had an accident with a speeding motorcycle on the way from Tainan to Kaohsiung.
    The accident induced him to launch a Python community in Kaohsiung. Therefore,
    Kaohsiung Python User Group was founded in 2014. In addition to casual meetups,
    which invites specialist from other cities, there is a regular gathering in
    Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages on one Monday night every month.
    They welcome anyone who passes by Kaohsiung to join the events.

    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taichung &mdash; Taichung.py</a></h3>
  <p>
    Taichung.py was started in 2014 by Prof. Yuan-Liang Tang and several enthusiasts.
    The events were held at restaurants or coffee shops until later Microprogram Co.
    supported the event venue. Now the events are held monthly in Saturday afternoon,

<h3><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hualien-Py/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hualien &mdash; Hualien.py</a></h3>
  <p>
    The history of Hualien.py can be dated back to 2013, Prof. Tzer-Jen Wei felt
    the lack of open source and technology communities in the east part of Taiwan.
    He started to invite Python speakers from other cities. Having speakers like
    c3h3, clkao and Mosky, Hualien.py began the first event in 2014. Events have
    been located in Hualien Railway Cultural Park, National Dong Hwa University,
    Hualien Cultural Creative Industries Park and so on. By the supports from
    all over the Taiwan, the community in Hualien thrives. Now there are more and
    more local speakers in the meetups. In addition to speeches, there are casual
    gathering and special focus workshop. Next time when having a trip in Taiwan
    east coast, drop by Hualien.py.
