<h2>Guidelines for Proposal Submission</h2>

<h3>Talks</h3>

<p>We accept a broad range of Python-related proposals, from academic research to commercial projects and case studies, or soft topics such as running a community, making good communication, mental health, etc.  Basically, if you are reading these words, you should go submit your proposal!</p>

<p>We encourage speakers to talk about your own Python package or application, your experience of learning Python or hosting a Python community etc. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well. For your inspiration, our committee has suggested that they’d love to see talks on following topics: <em>FinTech, Community, A.I, Data Analytics, IoT, Machine Learning, Testing</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Talks will be lasting either <em>30 minutes</em> or <em>45 minutes</em>, depends on you, you'll measure and decide how much time you need.  Note that the length of a talk <em>includes setup and Q&amp;A session</em>.</p>

<p>Talks can be given in either <em>English, Mandarin or Taiwanese Hokkien.</em></p>

<p>If it's your first time to propose a talk at PyCon Taiwan or a conference in general, please have a look at <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}">How to Propose a Talk?</a> to learn more about conventions, and it might help you organise your thoughts on your proposal.</p>

<h3>Tutorials</h3>

<p>
    Similar to talks, we don’t pose limitations on tutorial topics.
    Tutorials are paid, half or full day long, equivalent to 3 or 6 hours of teaching.
    The guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks,
    so make sure you have read <a href="{{ speaking_talk_url }}"> How to Propose a Talk?</a>
    On top of that, We have some special requirements for tutorial submission,
    please refer to <a href="{{ speaking_tutorial_url }}">How to Propose a Tutorial?</a>
    for more information.
</p>

<h2>Proposals Review Process</h2>

<p>After the Call for Proposal ends, and before the announcement of acceptance, the PyCon TW 2019 Proposals Review Committee is going to review the proposals and give scores and provide useful feebacks. The process consists of three phases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1 Review: Reviewers are going to score and give feedbacks. This will last for about 2 ~ 3 weeks</li>
  <li><em>Modification Step: According to reviewers’ comments, you can modify your proposal through the dashboard.</em> This steps lasts for about 1 to 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Stage 2 Review: Reviewers are going to re-score and re-give feedacks to the modified proposals</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modification Step</h3>
<p>
  Between the stage-1 and stage-2 review, you can see the feedbacks from the reviewer.
  You may modify your proposal according to reviewers’ comments or feedbacks. If you want to make your change obvious to the reviewers, you can point out the ID of the comment, and mention about what you’ve modified according to the comment in the <em>"Supplementary"</em> section, e.g. <em>"#4: Updated the time management for xxx phase"</em>
</p>
