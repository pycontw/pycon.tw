		<p>
			Amber Brown (HawkOwl) is a freelance software developer and the
			release manager of the Twisted project. She’s known for her Python 3
			porting drives and modernisation of the Twisted codebase. She is a
			frequent speaker, keynoting DjangoCon AU ’15, PyCon CZ ’15, and
			speaking at PyCon Australia and Django Under The Hood.
		</p>
		<h4 class="keynote-speaker__bio__header">Talk: “Django & Twisted”</h4>
		<p>
			Web frameworks like Django are designed around the traditional
			request-response cycle — a request comes in, a response is generated, and
			that is delivered to the client. In the day of “single page”
			applications, where only sections of the page are updated through
			requests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build
			off it, like Django Channels, might be the way forward. What problems
			does this fix? How does this make the user experience better? What new
			issues arise when you're doing everything asynchronously? And how will
			this change in the future? are all topics we'll get in to.

		<h4 class="keynote-speaker__bio__header">Talk: “Python 導入系統軟體教學”</h4>
		<p>系統軟體一般指編譯器、作業系統、虛擬機器，動態二進位轉換/編譯器一類所謂「比較硬」的軟體技術，往往需要搭配計算機架構 / 平行計算 / 網路架構 / GPU 等背景知識的熟稔，開發者必須破除典型以計算為主的思維，在系統層面觀察實際資料的流動，佐以軟硬體綜合規劃的方式去分析系統運作，從而改善效能。講者這四年在大學任教，就是帶著學生理解各式系統軟體，不乏「自幹」前述元件作為基礎訓練，過程中透過 Python 縮減系統驗證、自動化設計，以及視覺化的成本，希望藉由本議程分享相關經驗。</p>

			Paul Hildebrandt has been a Senior Engineer with Walt Disney
			Animation Studios (WDAS) since 1996, and has worked in both Systems
			and Software engineering. His current title is Senior Software
			Engineer and Product Owner for the Playback tools among his primary
			duties is spending time working with the artists, understanding
			their needs, and designing tools to assist them. If he is lucky, he
			gets to write code.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hildebrandt leads a team that is responsible for developing the
			digital asset manager, media player, dailies review system with a
			mobile interface, and other related tools. These tools are available
			on a variety of platforms including Linux, Mac, iOS, and Android.
			Among the Disney animated films that he has contributed are
			<cite>Zootopia</cite>, the Oscar® winning hits
			<cite>Big Hero 6</cite>, <cite>Frozen</cite> and Oscar®-nominated
			box office hits, <cite>Wreck-It Ralph</cite>, <cite>Tangled</cite>,
			<cite>Bolt</cite>, <cite>Treasure Planet</cite>, and
			<cite>Dinosaur</cite>. He is WDAS’ evangelist for PyCon and other
			Python sponsorships.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prior to joining Disney, Hildebrandt spent eight years with Hughes
			Aircraft as a Senior Engineer working on commercial in-flight
			entertainment for airlines and the Stealth Bomber trainers. He also
			served as the electrical lead for a team that raced a solar car
			across Australia in the 1990 World Solar Challenge. The team
			finished in the top third.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hildebrandt was born and raised in Anaheim, California. He received
			his BSEE with a focus on Computing from California Polytechnic
			University Pomona. He resides outside of Los Angeles with his wife
			and three boys.
		</p>
		<h4 class="keynote-speaker__bio__header">Talk: “Inside the Hat: Python @ Walt Disney Animation Studios”</h4>
		<p>
			Paul will take you through the process of making of a Disney movie. He
			will use examples from Zootopia to explain and illustrate the steps in
			making a movie and explain where technology, specifically Python, is
			involved.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Walt Disney Animation Studios has a long history of creating
			acclaimed animated films and continues to be an industry leader with
			regards to artistic achievements, storytelling excellence, and
			cutting-edge innovations. Since the 1923 release of Snow White they’ve
			been pushing forward technology in the art of movie making. This push
			continues in the modern day with classics such as Oscar winning box
			office hits "Big Hero 6" and “Frozen” and Oscar nominated hits “Wreck-It
			Ralph”, “Tangled”, “Bolt”, “Treasure Planet”, and “Dinosaur”.
		</a>
		<p>
			One of the most common questions we get when attending PyCon is “Why are
			you here?”  People seem confused that technology, especially Python is
			used in the making of animated films.

		<p>
			Steve is an engineer who tells people about Python and then gives
			them excuses to use it and great tools to use it with. He works on
			Python Tools for Visual Studio, contributes to many of Microsoft’s
			Python libraries, and is a core contributor and Windows expert for
			CPython.
		</p>
		<p>
			He now works as a software engineer at Microsoft.

		<h4 class="keynote-speaker__bio__header">Talk: “Intentional Communication”</h4>
		<p>
			Do you know how to talk? Do you know how to write? Good! Those are how
			you tell people about your ideas, whether online, at conferences, in
			printed media, or in code. But when you talk or write, are you thinking
			about why? Are you intentional about your message, your medium, and your
			meaning? In this session, Steve will explore some of the things to think
			about whenever you sit down to write, stand up to speak, or open your
			laptop to code. Not everyone will be a better speaker or writer by the
			end, but you will be able to be a more intentional communicator.
