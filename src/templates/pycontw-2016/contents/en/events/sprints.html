<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Two sprints will be held out of the conference dates. During the sprint,
	open source project managers will bring their projects and explain their
	issues or any unresolved problem. After the introduction of all projects,
	people find their projects of interest and get involved. By this
	interaction possibility, one can dig deep into projects or fields they
	care.
</p>
<p>
	It is highly welcomed to bring oneâ€™s own project and find enthusiasts of
	same interest. For people with sufficient Python background who wants to
	join open source projects but having no clue or too shy to shout out
	on the mail list and public channels, sprints serve as a great chance to
	get involved.
</p>
<p>
	Running alongside there is a separate schedule of workshops in April for
	attendees who want to learn more about knowledge for specific topics.
</p>
