<p>
	Registration starts from now! This year, BoF is at the end of 2nd conference day (Jun 4).
</p>

<h2>What is BoF?</h2>
<h3>Birds of a feather flock together</h3>
<p>
	According to Wikipedia, BoF is derived from the proverb “Birds of a feather
	flock together.” A BoF session is an informal meeting at conferences, where
	the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out
	discussions without any pre-planned agenda.
</p>
<p>
	Do you want to share ideas and creative projects with others at PyCon TW?
	Everyone is welcomed to join the PyConTW 2016 BoF. Let us implement the
	future, together!

<h3>Do I Need to Prepare Anything?</h3>
<p>
	Any topic related to Python and PyCon is appreciated during BoF. Feel free to
	raise your own topic. We also provide an abundant supply of food!
</p>
<p>
	You can register as a host, and bring new or funny projects—fighting robots,
	LED control system, lighting, sound system, etc. If you find no time to
	prepare a project, you are also welcomed to sing a song, play some guitar, or
	anything.
</p>
<p>
	It is also great to just be an audience. Seize this opportunity to make
	friends, broaden your horizons, or recruit volunteers! Welcome to BoF!
