<p>
	Events at PyCon Taiwan 2016 can be divided into two: Those during the
	conference (June 3–5), and those out of it (tutorials, sprints, and PyDay).
</p>

<h2>Out of the Conference</h2>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>
	Tutorials are paid events that will be held 1 to 3 weeks before PyCon TW.
	They are held to help participants better understand talks during the
	conference, or get their hands on more Python applications. A tutorial can be
	either full-day (6 hours) or half-day (3 hours), with content selected by
	public proposal-calling.
</p>
<p>
	We offer both tutorials for Python newcomers who have never tried Python
	before, and also for specific topics such as controlling Raspberry Pi, data
	analysis, etc. Tickets for tutorials are sold separately from the conference.
	Make sure you complete registration for both events.
</p>
<p>
	More information about tutorials can be found on the
	<a href="{{ events_tutorials_url }}">Tutorial</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Sprints</h3>
<p>
	Two sprints will be held out of the conference. Open source project managers
	will bring their projects, and explain their issues and unresolved problems.
	After the introduction of all projects, you can pick the topics you are
	interested in, and join their work. It is a good chance to dig deep into
	projects or fields you care.
</p>
<p>
	Attendees are welcomed to bring their own project and find like-minded
	partners. It is also a great opportunity to join open source projects if you
	doesn’t have you own project idea, or are just too shy to shout out on the
	mailing list and public chat channels.
</p>
<p>
	There is also a separate schedule of workshops in April for attendees who
	want to learn more about specific topics.
</p>
<p>
	More information about sprints can be found on the
	<a href="{{ events_sprint_url }}">Sprint</a> page.
</p>

<h3>PyDay</h3>
<p>
	PyDay is an activity for newcomers held by PyCon TW and top univerisities in
	Taiwan. We invite keynote speakers from the conference to share their
	experience throughout sessions in this event. Book a PyDay ticket if you
	want to talk with keynote speakers after PyCon TW.
</p>
<p>
	More information about the PyDay can be found on the
	<a href="{{ events_pyday_url }}">PyDay</a> page.
</p>

<h2>During the Conference (June 3–5)</h2>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>
	There will be 5 speakers giving keynote speeches during the three-day
	conference, and we also offer live broadcast. Speakers of keynotes are
	globally outstanding people from their domains. They will share their
	experiences and imagination of the future.
</p>
<p>
	More information about keynotes can be found on the
	<a href="{{ events_keynote_url }}">Keynote</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Talks</h3>
<p>
	The three conference days are packed with talks about Python by speakers
	from Taiwan and around the world. The talks will be either 25- or 45-minute
	long. Three tracks of talks will be delivered simultaneously, all with
	different topics and difficulties. We suggest you to make a schedule
	beforehand, and choose what you want ot listen based on your interests. Many
	people take notes on the program schedule before the meeting so they don’t
	run to wrong places.
</p>
<p>
	The program schedule will be announced by the end of April. List of accepted
	talks can be found on the <a href="{{ events_talk_url }}">Talks</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>
	Lightning talks are full of excitement. Every speaker has to finish the
	presentation within 5 minutes—no exceptions! The stage is cruel, but is a
	great source of stimulation; inspiring and interesting presentations are
	given every year. Topics are widely accepted. This year, onsite registration
	is available. Bring your creativeness and share with us!
</p>

<h3>Job Fair</h3>
<p>
	This is the job fair specifically for Python engineer. There will be no
	session for the job fair, but the stage is opened for all companies to
	present. Feel free to interact with the exhibitors.
</p>

<h3>BoF (Birds of a Feather)</h3>
<p>
	BoF is derived from the proverb “Birds of a feather flock together.” A BoF
	session means an informal meeting at conferences, where the attendees group
	together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any
	pre-planned agenda. You are welcome to raise any subject you like. Let us
	build up the PyCon TW night as bustling as night markets in Taiwan! There
	will also be many eye-popping stage performances at the same time. (You are
	welcomed to perform on the stage as well!)
</p>
<p>
	More information about the BoF can be found on the
	<a href="{{ events_bof_url }}">BoF</a> page.
