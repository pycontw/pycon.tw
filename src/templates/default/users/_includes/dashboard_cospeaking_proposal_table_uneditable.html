    FIXME: This loop has an n+1 problem on "speaker_info.proposal". We can't
    do "selected_related" because it's generic, neither "prefetch_related"
    because it is (likely) not homogenous.

    This likely will not cause problems in practice, however. It's rare for
    a user to become a co-speaker in two or more proposals, so n+1 is likely
    around 3. Joining will likely require more queries.

    We can always come back if this ever become a real problem.
