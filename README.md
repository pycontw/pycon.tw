## How to Contribute

Follow the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), please **DO NOT push the commits into master directly**. Always create branch by the feature you want to update. You are encouraged to submit a pull request for reviewing before merging things into master.

We strongly recommend you configure your editor to match our coding styles. You can do this manually, or use an [EditorConfig plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) if your editor supports it. An `.editorconfig` file has already been attached to the repository.
